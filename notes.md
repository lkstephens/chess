# My Notes CS240

Interfaces define the method for another class to implement.  
Inheritance means that classes inherit attributes from another class.  
Abstract classes are a combination of interfaces and inheritance.  
Shallow Copy: pointer to instance data  
Deep Copy: Same values, two different memory loc  
Concrete Class: fully implemented
